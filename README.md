# JitsiMeet-Video-Conference-with-Firebase-Auth
A feature-rich video conferencing app built using Android Studio, powered by the Jitsi Meet API for seamless video calls. Includes Google authentication with Firebase for secure user login and efficient record management.


 Known Issues:-
1. **Authentication Update Required**: Firebase authentication tokens need to be refreshed periodically. Failure to do so may result in users being stuck on the loading screen after Google login.

2. **Android Studio Glitch**: Opening the authentication file in Android Studio may occasionally cause the app to fail during runtime, despite showing no errors. This appears to be a bug in the IDE.
